      <h2>What is Fermentation?</h2>
      <p>
        Lactic Acid Fermentation is a metabolic process that converts glucose into lactic acid, regenerates NAD<sup>+</sup> from NADH, and allows glycolysis to continue under anaerobic conditions. This process generates energy (ATP) when oxygen is limited, like for bacteria such as <em>Lactobacillus</em> (which is present in fermented foods). Glycolysis breaks down glucose into two pyruvate molecules (the conjugate base of acid).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is Pyruvate?</h2>
      <p>
        Pyruvate is a three-carbon molecule produced during glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose in the cellâ€™s cytoplasm. It is a crucial intermediate (a molecule in a multi-step reaction) in energy production, including fermentation and aerobic respiration. When oxygen is absent, pyruvate undergoes fermentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It regenerates NAD<sup>+</sup>, allowing glycolysis to continue producing ATP. Since there is a limited amount of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the cell, the electron acceptor must be regenerated to allow ATP production to continue. NADH donates electrons to pyruvate and regenerates NAD<sup>+</sup>, which produces lactic acid.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What are NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup>?</h2>
      <p>
        NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup> are coenzymes known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide compounds that help cellular processes by transferring electrons.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>What is Pickling?</h2>
      <p>
        Pickling is the process of preserving food in an acidic brine. Brines are usually composed of salt water, lemon juice, or vinegar and create a low pH solution that preserves the food. Various foods can be pickled, including vegetables, meat, and fish. Pickling is a physical change, not a chemical one.
      </p>
      <p>
        During pickling, the food absorbs the brine through osmosis, altering flavor and preservation. The high salt or acid content dehydrates and inhibits spoilage microorganisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although fermentation and pickling are different, fermentation occurs in pickle brine. Beneficial bacteria break down sugars to make lactic acid, which makes the brine even more effective against unwanted microbes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ideal Conditions for Pickling</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A vinegar solution of at least 5% acetic acid is required for the brine.</li>
        <li>The brine's pH must be lower than 4.6 for proper acidity.</li>
        <li>Brine is generally made with a 3:2:1 ratio of vinegar to water to sugar â€” sugar helps healthy bacteria grow.</li>
        <li>Salt and spices (like mustard seeds and peppercorns) are added based on recipes.</li>
        <li>Jars should be stored in the dark at 70â€“75Â°F for optimal lactic acid fermentation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>History of Pickles</h2>
      <p>
        Pickling dates back to 2400 BC in ancient Mesopotamia, where vinegar-based brine was used to preserve vegetables, including cucumbers. Pickles spread to Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians, who believed pickles had health and beauty benefits. Roman soldiers relied on pickles during campaigns due to their long shelf life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pickles became popular in Europe during the Middle Ages and were introduced to the Americas by European explorers. Regional variations emerged worldwide, from dill pickles in Eastern Europe to spicy pickles in India and Korea, showing how a simple preservation method became a global culinary tradition.

      <h2>Pickling Procedure</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to make delicious pickles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cut up cucumber and jalapeÃ±os, then fill a mason jar with them.</li>
        <li>Smash 4 garlic cloves and add to the jar.</li>
        <li>In a pot, add 1Â½ cups of white vinegar and water.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of pickling spices (mustard seeds, black peppercorns, coriander seeds, and red pepper flakes) and 2 tablespoons of kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Heat the mixture until it shimmers, then pour it into the jar until full.</li>
        <li>Measure the pH of the mixture initially and at the end of the process.</li>
        <li>Calculate the concentration of lactic acid.</li>
      </ul>
